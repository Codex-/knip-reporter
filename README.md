[![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/codex-/knip-reporter/ci.yml?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Codex-/knip-reporter/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Marketplace-knip‚Äìreporter-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmarketplace%2Factions%2Fawait-remote-run)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/knip-reporter)

This action runs [knip](https://github.com/webpro/knip), parses the results, and posts the report as comments on the related pull request.

## Usage

The execution of `knip` requires you to have followed the general `knip` setup and have a command script present in your `package.json` file, `knip`, by default but this can be of any name. If this script name deviates from the standard `knip` setup, please provide the script name in the config.

`knip-reporter` appends a reporter to the `knip` command used, `--reporter jsonExt`, to output a parseable report with information needed for annotations where supported.

```yaml
name: Pull Request
on:
  pull_request:

# This permissions config is only required if you are not providing
# own permissive token or if you disable annotations.
permissions:
  checks: write

steps:
  - name: Post the knip results
    uses: codex-/knip-reporter@v1
```
